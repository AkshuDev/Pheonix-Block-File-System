# PBFS - Pheonix Block File System / Python-Based File System

> A future-proof, ultra-large-scale block-level file system designed for modern and forward-compatible computing needs.

---

## Why Two Names?

PBFS is referred to as:

- **Pheonix Block File System**: When discussing block-level storage, structure, and system integration. This is the PBFS in this github repo.
- **Python-Based File System**: When focusing on its implementation, which is purely in Python. It is the first PBFS that is created purely in python.

Both are valid and describe different aspects of the same system.
